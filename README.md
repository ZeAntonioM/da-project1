# Programming project 1 of Design of Algorithms

## 1. Objectives and Problem Motivation

In this project we had to develop an analysis tool that can support
the management team of a railway network to make informed decisions
about how to best allocate its resources, both financial as well as
physical. To complete this tasks, we had to make a realistic implementation
of greedy algorithms of maximum-flow calculus.
